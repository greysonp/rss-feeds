# RSS Feeds
A static file containing a list of popular RSS feeds. This is the result of running my [RSS Scraper](https://github.com/greysonp/rss-scraper). This repository exists to provide static hosting of this JSON file via Github Pages, which can be found [here](https://greysonp.github.io/rss-feeds/feeds.json).

## Why?
I couldn't find a good open data source of popular RSS feeds. The [Google Feeds API](https://developers.google.com/feed/) may exist now, but it's going away soon. The idea is that people could use the data found here to power their own search.
